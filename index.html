			<div><p class = "my_life">I was born in france and came to israel in 2006. I always was pasionate about videogames and always dream on creating my own videogames.
				 <br> As soon as I had my own computer I began learning about coding and creating content (pixel art, blog creation, video games modding ect ect).
				 <br> Eventually I joined The Nahal Brigade of the IDF for my 3 Years military service, I evolve from a common soldier to commander and finnaly to sergeant with 50 soldier under my responsability.This experience gave me a lot of new skills such as <span>Leadership</span>, <span>Work under duress</span>, <span>Team Work</span>, <span>Managment</span> and <span>Strategic thinking</span>.
				 <br> When I quit the army and after a well deserved year off I started working as a security officer in an hotel, it was a student job that allowed me to pay for my computer science degree. The most valuable skill I picked up from that experience was probably <span>Customer Service</span> as I had to deal with a lot of angry and happy customer during those 5 years ... 
				 <br> When the corona started in 2020 i was let go of that job and no longer had the money to pay for my degree, I had to stop university to find a job and I tried on my own to keep learning programing and find alternate solutions to university. 
				 <br> 2 Years later I found Developer Institute that was exactly what I was looking for a course that will teach me practical programing skills and help me land my first job!! 
				 <br>
				 <br> That's all so far !! The story of how I ended up here ...
				 <br> If you want to be a part of the next chapter <span>Hire Me !!!</span></p></div>
